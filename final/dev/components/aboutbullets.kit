<h1>Craigslist is about:</h1>
<h1>Giving each other a break, getting the word out about everyday, real-world stuff.</h1>
<h1>Restoring the human voice to the Internet, in a humane, non-commercial environment.</h1>
<h1>Keeping things simple, common-sense, down-to-earth, honest, very real.</h1>
<h1>Providing an alternative to impersonal, big-media sites.</h1>
<h1>Being inclusive, giving a voice to the disenfranchised, democratizing...</h1>
<h1>Being a collection of communities with similar spirit, not a single monolithic entity.</h1>
